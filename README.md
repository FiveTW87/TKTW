# TKTW — Three Kingdoms: Traitor Within

A Thai-language Sanguosha-style hidden-role card game engine (3–10 players).
Standard Edition rules, Identity Mode, built engine-first: a pure TypeScript
rules engine with no framework/network/DOM dependency, tested entirely
through Vitest and a headless CLI simulator — no UI needed to prove the
rules work.

## Status

| Phase | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **P0** | Engine core — RNG, event stack, decisions, turn loop, distance, judgment, HP/death, hidden-info filter | ✅ Done |
| **P1** | Full 104-card deck, all basic/instant/delayed tricks, all weapons/armor/horses | ✅ Done |
| **P2** | 25 generals with skills | 🟡 12 / 25 |
| **P3** | Identity Mode (role assignment, win conditions) | ⬜ Not started |
| **P4** | Server (Node + Socket.IO) | ⬜ Not started |
| **P5** | Client (React + Framer Motion) | ⬜ Not started |

Generals implemented so far: โจโฉ, สุมาอี้ (both skills, incl. the
judgment-rewrite "อัจฉริยะปีศาจ"), แฮหัวตุ้น, เคาทู, เตียวหุย, กวนอู,
ม้าเฉียว, จิวยี่, เอียนสี, อุยกาย, ซุนซางเซียง, ลกซุน.

58 tests passing, including headless fuzz runs (1000+ games with bots only,
300+ games with real generals assigned) that play full games to completion
with no hangs or crashes.

## Architecture

```
packages/
  engine/            <- the whole rules engine (pure TS, zero deps beyond Vitest)
    src/
      core/          <- turn loop, event stack, triggers, decisions, distance,
                        judgment, damage, view (hidden-info filter)
      cards/         <- one file per card type's play/judge effect
      equipment/     <- weapon/armor hooks that aren't simple stats
      generals/      <- one file per general's skills
      data/           <- cards.json (104-card deck, balance-verified)
      bots/          <- a deliberately dumb bot used for fuzz testing
      sim/           <- CLI entry point
    tests/
```

Three kinds of hooks a general/equipment skill can register:

- **Trigger** (`TriggerPoint`) — reacts to something that already happened
  (`OnDamaged`, `OnDying`, `BeforeJudgeEffect`, …). Async, generator-based,
  can ask the owner a yes/no question before running.
- **Query** (`QueryHookName`) — a synchronous rule consulted while resolving
  something else (`canConvertCard`, `distanceModifier`, `shaUsageLimit`, …).
  Not an event — just a fact the engine asks for.
- **Active skill** — a player-initiated choice offered alongside "play a
  card" / "end phase" during the play phase (e.g. Zhou Yu's "กลไส้ศึก").

Every "who can see what" concern goes through a single function,
`projectFor(state, viewerId)`, that lives in the engine itself — not in a
server layer — so the same fuzz-testing bots that fake-play thousands of
games can never accidentally cheat by reading hidden state, which is what
makes the fuzz runs a meaningful integrity check rather than a happy-path
smoke test.

Decisions the engine is waiting on (dodge a สังหาร, respond to wuxie, judge
a card, etc.) are driven through plain JS generators for ergonomics, with
an event-sourced decision log alongside so a session can be reconstructed
after a crash/restart by replaying the recorded answers against a fresh
generator from the same seed — nothing about "what's currently paused" has
to be serialized directly.

## Running it

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test          # full Vitest suite
pnpm sim --players 8 --seed 12345   # watch one full headless game play out
```

`pnpm sim` options: `--players 3-10`, `--seed <n>`, `--games <n>`, `--quiet`.

## Design notes / known simplifications

- Card-conversion and passive query hooks are always consulted correctly
  scoped to their owner (`ctx.ownerId === payload.playerId`) — this was a
  real bug caught before it shipped: an early version let Guan Yu's "red
  card counts as สังหาร" apply to *every* player, not just him.
- A few Tier-B skills apply slightly more broadly than the literal spec
  wording for simplicity (e.g. Cao Ren's damage bonus applies to all damage
  he deals that turn, not just สังหาร/ดวล specifically) — flagged inline
  with `// simplification` comments at each site.
- The bundled bot is intentionally simple (no strategy, declines every
  optional/active skill by default) — it exists to prove the engine doesn't
  hang or crash across thousands of games, not to play well. A handful of
  the trickier interactions (bagua's judge-based dodge, zhangba's 2-card
  substitute sha, Zhou Yu's active skill) have dedicated focused tests
  instead, since the bot never triggers them on its own.

## Spec

Standard Edition, Identity Mode, 3–10 players. Card/general data was
redesigned from scratch (not copied from any existing implementation) so
the 104-card deck's probabilities land on clean numbers and there's no
GPL entanglement — see `tests/balance.test.ts` for the verified structure.
